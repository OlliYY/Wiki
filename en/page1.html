    <p>
        Software development is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications.
        It encompasses a wide range of techniques, tools, and methodologies that enable efficient and high-quality
        software construction. Software development is an essential part of the modern information society, impacting
        nearly every aspect of life.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Software Development?</h2>
    <p>
        Software development refers to a systematic approach to creating software. It includes stages such as
        requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The development process can follow
        various models, such as the waterfall model or agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban).
    </p>

    <h2>Phases of Software Development</h2>
    <p>
        A typical software development project progresses through the following phases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Requirements Gathering:</strong> What should the software do?</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Planning architecture and technical solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Actual coding and software construction.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Finding and fixing bugs and issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Updating and improving the software during its lifecycle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agile Software Development</h2>
    <p>
        Agile software development is a flexible and iterative approach that aims for quick feedback and continuous
        improvement. In agile methods, teams work in short sprints and hold regular reviews to assess progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Software development is a multi-phase and continuously evolving process that requires technical expertise,
        collaboration, and effective project management. Successful software development results in high-quality
        applications that meet user needs.
