# Work time tracking


## Why to log work hours?
Work hour tracking helps assess whether the schedule is being followed and it also supports the planning of future projects. Internship contracts usually define a target number of hours corresponding to the number of credits.
The logbook is filled in so that supervisors and teachers can review the hours spent and tasks completed, which makes it easier to calculate the earned credits. It’s recommended to update the Excel sheet at least once a week.
## 
How is work time log filled?
Work time tracking is filled in as an Excel table.

Example table.

You can create a similar sheet by following the steps below.

1.	Open an Excel-workbook and create a new table.

2.	Next open the “More” tab and select “Table”.

3.	The result looks something like this

From this point onward you should be able to modify the table to suit your needs.

## How are sick leaves handled?
Notify your supervisor about the day you are sick and unable to work. You can be absent for up to 5 days with a notification. After that, request a statement for extended sick leave from student health services. By default, sick leave days do not need to be compensated.

## How do I log absences?
Absences (including sick leave) can be logged in different ways, but the most important thing is that the reader can clearly see when the absences occurred. Including the reasons for absences is optional but recommended, especially if you haven’t separately informed your supervisor of the reason. Absences should be marked as zero-hour days.

If you have taken approved vacation days during your internship, mark down the vacation days using the same style.


## How is remote work recorded?
Remote workdays can be logged in different ways, but as with absences, the most important thing is that the reader can clearly see when the remote work was done and what it included. If you do partial remote work and frequently switch between working from home and school, it’s a good idea to mark down the remote day at the beginning of the workday so that the information is conveyed to your supervisor.
