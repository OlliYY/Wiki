# Explanation of Project Team Roles

## Project Team Roles

The roles within a project team vary depending on the size of the team and the subject of the project.  
This page presents an example of role distribution in a four-person team working on application development.

In larger teams, it may be necessary to divide the responsibilities of certain roles into separate positions.  
For example, the Full Stack Developer role can be split into Frontend and Backend Developer roles as needed.

## Project Manager

The Project Manager is responsible for the overall project.  
This includes the budget, scheduling, and resource management.

The Project Manager typically also plans the project phases, assigns tasks, and monitors progress.

## Frontend Developer

The Frontend Developer creates and maintains the applicationâ€™s user interface during the project.  
This means they work directly with what users see and interact with.

## Backend Developer

The Backend Developer creates and maintains the server-side logic of the application and any associated database throughout the project.

## Full Stack Developer

The Full Stack Developer is involved in the development of the entire application.

In other words, this role includes tasks from both the Backend and Frontend roles, but is not the primary person responsible for either.
